	* dist_conf/suse, dist_conf/kolab/, dist_conf/common,
	  dist_conf/gentoo: Added new variable TAR
	* kolab_bootstrap.in: Added a condition to the slave setup so that
	  it won't try to edit the "@sysconfdir@/rc.conf" file if kolabd was built
	  with "--without-openpkg"

2007-01-08 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* templates/resmgr.conf.template.in: fix the path to the freebusy
	  directory

2007-01-08 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/suse, dist_conf/kolab, dist_conf/common,
	  dist_conf/gentoo, templates/virtual.template.in,
          templates/transport.template.in: changed emailserver_transport_usr
	  to emailserver_tables_usr.

2006-12-15  Gunnar Wrobel  <wrobel@pardus.de>

	* templates/amavisd.conf.template.in: 

	Added all domain names into the local domains known to amavis so

2006-11-14 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/suse, dist_conf/kolab, dist_conf/common,
	  dist_conf/gentoo, templates/virtual.template.in,
          templates/transport.template.in: Added a new variable 
	  emailserver_transport_usr

2006-11-01  Gunnar Wrobel  <wrobel@pardus.de>

	* templates/freebusy.conf.template.in: 

	Commit
	http://kolab.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs-kolab.cgi/server/kolab-resource-handlers/kolab-resource-handlers/freebusy/freebusy.php.in.diff?r1=1.3&r2=1.4
	leads to resmgr/misc.php not being imported before
	freebusy.conf. Consequently RM_LOG_DEBUG remains undefined an
	results in an error. Either the order of the include statements in
	kolab-resource-handlers/freebusy/freebusy.php.in is being changed
	or the template uses integer values for the log_level. Chose the
	second option for now.

	In addition $params['cache_dir'] was set to @freebusy_cachedir@ in
	order to get the correct path under all distributions.
	

2006-10-02	Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	* templates/slapd.conf.template.in: fixed issue1426 - thanks
	Gunnar!

2006-09-27  Bernhard Reiter <bernhard@intevation.de>
	* DB_CONFIG.slapd.template.in: Fixing set_lk_detect setting,
	also adding the meaning from the documentation. Thanks
	to Gunnar Wrobel for spotting. 
	Resolves: kolab/issue1428 (Last commit on DB_CONFIG.slapd.template.in
	breaks the LDAP db) 

2006-09-26  Bernhard Reiter <bernhard@intevation.de>

	* templates/main.cf.template.in: activated limit on
	local delivery recipients again, with hint to remove it if issue825
	is fixed.

2006-09-25  Bernhard Reiter <bernhard@intevation.de>

	* templates/main.cf.template.in: Moved recipient_delimiter = +
	up because it also influences canonical, virtual and more.

	Changed to directly use kolabmailboxfilter from local_transport
	without local(8). This fixes kolab/issue824 and seems better
	because local(8) will take aliases and .forward files into account.
	This change was made in rev. 1.16 main.cf.template and got 
	lost during autoconfiscation. Added example for an alternative
	fix of issue824 keeping local(8).

2006-08-28  Bernhard Reiter <bernhard@intevation.de>

	* templates/master.cf.template.in: added envelope_recipient
	to masquerade_classes. According to Postfix' documention it was
	missing to allow for delivery to local machines, which we do
	not want to do in a standard Kolab Server setup. 
	Removed the masquerade_exceptions = root line, as we can get
	the information where an email to root@machine came from also
	from the connection itself and it is good to be closer to the default.

2006-06-26  Thomas Arendsen Hein <thomas@intevation.de>

	* templates/master.cf.template.in: Updated postfix master.cf.template
	to match master.cf from OpenPKG. Fixes the missing relay service (new
	in Postfix 2.2), everything else is cleanup or commented out by
	default.

2006-04-13 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	* templates/master.cf.template.in: replaced @bindir@/php with @PHP@
	* dist_conf/suse: changed the location for the ldapserver_argsfile,
	  ldapserver_pidfile and ldapserverslurpd_pidfile

2006-04-04 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* templates/httpd.conf.template.in: Without DOCUMENT_ROOT the rewrite
	  engine uses a real /freebusy directory on the filesystem before
	  %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/freebusy.  This may result in unexpected behaviour.

2006-04-03 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	Patch committed by Richard Bos
	* dist_conf/common, dist_conf/kolab, dist_conf/suse,
	  templates/freebusy.conf.template.in: introduction of freebusy_usr
	  and freebusy_grp.

2006-03-26 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* templates/php.ini.template.in: use the variable phpini_dir instead

2006-03-26 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	Patch committed by Richard Bos
	* dist_conf/{common,suse,kolab}, templates/main.cf.template.in:
	  Introduced new variable @aliases_file@

2006-03-26 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>

	  for the directory that holds the php.ini file to be used.

2006-03-16 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	Patch committed by Richard Bos
	* dist_conf/suse: run as user kolab instead of nobody.

2006-03-11 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/suse, change te ldap replication log location.  This
	  seems to solve the issue that changes in the webinterface are not
	  propagated to the backend, as administrated in issue 1068:
	  https://intevation.de/roundup/kolab/issue1068.
	  In the old location the directory was not writable by the ldap
	  daemon, in the new location /var/run/slapd/ it is.

2006-03-02 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	Patch committed by Richard Bos
	* dist_conf/common, dist_conf/kolab, dist_conf/suse,
	  kolab_bootstrap.in, kolab_sslcert.sh.in: introduced a new
	  variable pki_grp for public key infrastructure (pki) group support.

	  https://intevation.de/roundup/kolab/issue1105.
	  Remove "+" in chmod command.

2006-02-05 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/common, dist_conf/kolab, dist_conf/suse'
	  templates/session_vars.php.template.in: introduce a new build
	  variable: kolab_php_module_prefix.  This variable makes it possible
	  to store all kolab php modules in its own module.  E.g on suse it
	  will be /usr/share/php/kolab.  This prevents scattering of sources.

2006-02-04 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* templates/ldapdistlist.cf.template.in,
	  templates/master.cf.template.in,
	  templates/smtpd.conf.template.in,
	  templates/transport.template.in,
	  templates/virtual.template.in: changed the owner and group from
	  root to respectively: @emailserver_usr@ and @emailserver_grp@.
	  This means that the ownership and group changed to respectively:
	  kolab-n and kolab-r!

	* templates/amavisd.conf.template.in: commented out the variable
	  MYHOME and assigned it the value @amavisd_home@ from the dist_conf
	  file.  The LOGFILE variable has been assigned the variable:
	  @amavisd_logfile@, see tracker:
	  https://intevation.de/roundup/kolab/issue1088

2006-01-31 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>

          kolab_smtpdpolicy_conffile_grp variables.

2006-01-23 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* kolabquotawarn.in: removed \n in error string, seems redundant.

2006-01-18 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/suser: add /etc/php.ini to the backup list.

2006-01-18 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>

	  ldapserver_rgrp variable.
	* kolab_bootstrap.in: use @ldapserver_rgrp@ variable

2006-01-16 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* kolab_bootstrap.in: use @kolab_rgrp@ iso @kolab_rusr@ in chgrp
	  command.
	* revert the previous update; use @ldapserver_usr@ instead of
	  @kolab_musr@, as it did not work as expected.

2006-01-16 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* kolab_bootstrap.in: use @ldapserver_usr@ instead of @kolab_musr@ to
	  alter the ownership of the files $pubreskey $privreskey on the
	  master server.
	* templates/session_vars.php.template.in: use @webserver_musr@ instead
	  of @kolab_musr@

	  templates/saslauthd.conf.template.in,
	  templates/smtpd.conf.template.in: use more fine grained variables
	  for sasl configuration files.  Changed emailserver_sasl_confdir to
	  sasl_smtpdconffile and sasl_confdir to sasl_authdconffile.

2006-01-14 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/kolab: removed restricted_kolab_usr and restricted_kolab_grp
	  use the real value 'kolab-r' instead

	  variables, like: @l_ngrp@, @l_musr@, etc as they are not used in
	  the suse environment
	  Corrected emailserver_sasl_conffile for suse.
	  Changed most of the users and groups to root, this is a known user

2005-12-19 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* dist_conf/common, dist_conf/kolab, dist_conf/suse: added phppeardir
	  and changed BASH to BASHELL (it appeared after a little experimenting
	  that the variable BASH does not get updated in configure, as it is
	  already set by bash itself....)

2005-12-18 Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de>
	Patch committed by Richard Bos
	* Makefile.am: removed redundant prefix dist_
	  Removed commented out lines

2005-12-17 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>

	  file is distributed by default.
	  Changed kolabdocdir to $(pkgdocdir)/@PACKAGE@ as that makes it the
	  same for all modules.

2005-12-13 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* adduser.in, deluser.in, listusers.in, newconfig.in,
	  services.in, showlog.in, showuser.in, start.in and stop.in:
	  Added PATH variable, removed the full path from used commands as
	  they are now defined by the PATH variable
	  Changed --showhelp to --help
	  Changed 'cat .. | grep .. | sed ..' into just sed -n 's/../../p'

2005-12-12 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
        * showuser.in: moved to new prefix stuff

2005-12-11 Richard Bos <richard@radoeka.nl>
	* Makefile.am: fixed a typo: templtes should be templates
	  - kolabdocdir was not using the dist_conf file.  It is now, and the
	    documentation directory can be defined with: pkgdocdir
	  - kolabrcdir was not using the dist_conf file.  It is now, and the
	    rc directory can be defined with: kolab_rcdir
	  - Added ChangeLog, NEWS, COPYING and AUTHORS to the document files
	    to be distributed.
	  - INSTALL will be included in the tarbal
	  - Changed the document path to $(pkgdocdir)/kolabd (that is
	    ../share/kolab/doc, to .../share/doc/kolabd.  To prevent classes
	    with files named the same (e.g. ChangeLog) from other modules.

	* templates/slapd.conf.template.in (require): For some reason, the
	new OpenLDAP version from OpenPKG 2.5 doesn't accept the value
	"none" for "require".  according to the manpage it's the default
	anyway, so we comment it out.
	(suffix): With the new OpenLDAP version, suffix has to be defined
	before checkpoint, so rearrange it a bit.

	* templates/amavisd.conf.template.in ($myhostname): The new
	amavisd version from OpenPKG 2.5 actually checks whether the value
	is a FQDN.  This is not the case for the default value taken from
	uname on all systems, so explictly set it.
